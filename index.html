    My name is Riley Larch. 
    I am currently a first year at <Strong> North Carolina State University </Strong> with a Computer Science <em> intent </em>. 
    I chose to major in Computer Science for <ins> many reasons </ins>. 
    My dad is a software engineer so I was exposed to computers and coding at a young age and the job stability were my main reasons.

    My dream would be a fully remote position. 
    This would allow me to travel the world while still being able to work and gain experience.
    My dream would be to sublease apartments and live in each location for a couple of months before moving.
